# Air-Plane-Simulation-using-Computer-Graphics-

In the "Plane Crash Simulation" video game, a plane takes off at dusk and flies over the night sky. Eventually, because of the poor visibility, it collides with a structure, which then collapses. The main goal is to show that you grasp computer graphics concepts. 

Highlights🚀:

✽ Extensively used the C, OpenGL, and GLUT framework functions.

✽ Created objects like the moon, sun, clouds, and bush using different Open GL shape functions, then deployed the simulation's functionality using other Open GL built-in functions.

It depends extensively on Computer Graphics, Glut Framework, and Open GL libraries.In the "Plane Crash Simulation" video game, a plane takes off at dusk and flies over the night sky.
